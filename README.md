# Monster Guessr

[MH Guessr][MHG-url] is a web game, where players can test their knowledge about the locations from the game [Monster Hunter World](https://www.monsterhunter.com/world/).
Player recieves a series of screenshots, and the goal of the game is to guess the exact position of taken images.

App inspired by https://www.geoguessr.com/.

## Description

The game contains two gamemodes: **easy** and **normal** mode. In easy mode, the locations to guess will be more recognizable and iconic, while the second mode will be more challanging and intended for more experienced players.
After selecting a game mode from the main menu, the player will get a map, the mentioned screenshot, and a section where the player can select a desired map (Monster Hunter World consists of a few separate unique maps). Players task is to guess the position closest
to the one shown on the screen. There are 5 random screenshots per game and each one is worth up to 500 points. Player can zoom in on the map, as well as the screenshot.
